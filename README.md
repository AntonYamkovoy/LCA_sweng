 Part 1:
 
 Standard binary tree, algorithm for finding the Least Common Ancestor (LCA).
 
The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) T is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants, where we define each node to be a descendant of itself (so if v has a direct connection from w, w is the lowest common ancestor).

Part 2:

Implement this function further to include Direct Acyclic Graphs as inputs.
